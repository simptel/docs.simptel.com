### Introduction to Visitors

The concept of "Visitors" is central to our commitment towards user consent, privacy, and robust adherence to data protection regulations. Its design is primarily aimed at boosting the user experience by ensuring compliance, security, and the protection of user identities.

# Visitors Management

Our Identity Hub incorporates the visitor management suite with a comprehensive array of features to oversee visitor activities and consents while upholding data anonymization. It also provides detailed information about the sessions to which visitors are associated.

- Visitor Consent Management
- Visitor Session Management

The system consistently tracks and logs visitor behavior during sessions, ensuring a secure, personalized, and compliant user experience. Consents are garnered through public clients via API calls originating from various domains, all of which are automatically identified and processed by our system.

By persistently tracking and logging visitor behavior across sessions, we ensure not only a secure and compliant user experience, but also one that is personalized and engaging.
