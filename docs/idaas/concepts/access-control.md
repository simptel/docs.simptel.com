# Access Control Overview

This section provides an overview of the essential concepts guiding access control, encompassing authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) within our system.

## Authentication
Authentication (authn) is the process of verifying the identity of users, systems, or entities attempting to access our platform. Robust authentication mechanisms ensure that only authorized and legitimate users gain entry.

## Authorization
Authorization (authz) involves granting or denying permissions to authenticated entities based on their identity. This step defines the actions or operations users are allowed to perform once their identity is verified through authentication.

## Accounting
Accounting (auditing) involves logging and monitoring access events. It provides a record of who accessed what resources, when, and the actions taken. Accounting is crucial for security monitoring, compliance, and incident response.

## Access Control Models

In our platform, we offer various access control models, each providing different levels of granularity for controlling resource access.

### Role-based Access Control (RBAC)

Role-based Access Control (RBAC) is a robust access control model that restricts access to authorized users based on predefined roles. RBAC defines access permissions to resources based on user roles, rather than individual attributes. Each role is associated with a set of permissions that determine the actions a user with that role is allowed to perform.

```javascript
// RBAC Example
if (role === "manager") {
    // Allow access to the sensitive document
} else {
    // Deny access
}
```

### Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC)
Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) is a granular access control mechanism that enables fine-grained control over resource access based on the attributes associated with users or clients. ABAC protects resources at a granular level by considering specific attributes such as `roles`, `permissions`, `deparments`, `office hours`, and `locations`. This approach enables precise access controls based on specific user attributes, ensuring strong data security and compliance with best practices.

**ABAC Example:**
```javascript
// ABAC Example
if (
    attributes.includes("role:manager") &&
    attributes.includes("permission:read:document") &&
    attributes.includes("department:marketing") &&
    attributes.includes("location:office")
) {
    // Allow access to the sensitive document
} else {
    // Deny access
}

```

### Access Control Lists (ACLs)

Access Control Lists (ACLs) are a mechanism for specifying which users or groups of users are granted access to specific resources and what operations they are allowed to perform on those resources. ACLs detail exactly what operations are permitted and denied for specific users or groups, providing fine-grained control over resource access.


**ACL Examples:**

```javascript

// ACL Example 2
if (user === "john" && permission === "read" && document === "campaign_strategy.docx") {
    // Allow access to the sensitive document
} else {
    // Deny access
}

```
