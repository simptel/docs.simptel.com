# Access Control Overview

This chapter provides an in-depth overview of the essential concepts guiding access control, encompassing authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) within our platform.

## Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of users, systems, or entities attempting to access our platform. Robust authentication mechanisms ensure that only authorized and legitimate users gain entry.

## Authorization
Authorization involves granting or denying permissions to authenticated entities based on their identity. This step defines the actions or operations users are allowed to perform once their identity is verified through authentication.

## Accounting
Accounting, often referred to as auditing, involves logging and monitoring access events. It provides a record of who accessed what resources, when, and the actions taken. Accounting is crucial for security monitoring, compliance, and incident response.

## Access Control Models

### Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC)
Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) is a granular access control mechanism that enables fine-grained control over resource access based on attributes associated with users or clients.

In our system, we use ABAC to protect resources at a granular level. For example, the "get user profile" endpoint requires attributes like `read:user`, `write:user`, `delete:user`, and `create:user`. This approach enables precise access controls based on specific user attributes, ensuring strong data security and compliance with best practices.

```javascript
// ABAC Example
if (
    userAttributes.includes("userRole:manager") &&
    userAttributes.includes("department:marketing") &&
    userAttributes.includes("location:office")
) {
    // Allow access to user profile
} else {
    // Deny access
}

```

## Role-based Access Control (RBAC)

Role-based Access Control (RBAC) is a robust access control model that restricts access to authorized users based on predefined roles.

In our system, RBAC defines access permissions to resources based on user roles, rather than individual attributes. Each role is associated with a set of attributes that determine the actions a user with that role is allowed to perform.

```javascript
// RBAC Example
if (userRole === "Manager") {
    // Allow access to sensitive data
} else {
    // Deny access
}
```
