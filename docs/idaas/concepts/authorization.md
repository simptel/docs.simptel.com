# Authorization Concepts and Principles

This chapter provides an overview of the essential concepts and principles guiding the authorization mechanisms and access control within our system. Our primary authorization protocol is the OAuth framework, chosen to ensure secure communication exchange wherever possible.

## Authorization

### Authorization Code Flow with PKCE for Users

The Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is a secure and fundamental aspect of our authorization strategy, providing enhanced security against code injection attacks. It is used to obtain access tokens on behalf of a user and can be implemented using client libraries for the following common use cases:

- Mobile Applications
- SaaS Platforms
- Websites
- Desktop Applications
- Single Sign-On (SSO)

### Client Credential Flow for Machine-to-Machine Communication

The Client Credential Flow enables secure authorization for machine-to-machine communication and non-user specific access to protected resources. This flow allows clients to securely authenticate and obtain access tokens based on their credentials. It can be implemented using client libraries for the following common use cases:

- Scheduled Tasks and Cron Jobs
- Data Synchronization
- System-to-system integrations
- Inter-Microservice Communication
- Internet of Things (IoT) Device Communication
- Automated Testing Environments

## Access Management

### Privileged Access Management (PAM)

Privileged Access Management (PAM) is integral to our access control framework, encompassing security strategies and technologies to manage, control, and monitor privileged access to critical systems. PAM ensures stringent controls over privileged user access.

### Attribute-based Access Control for Granularity

Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) provides fine-grained access control based on attributes associated with users, resources, and environmental conditions. This method enables precise control over resource access, contributing to our overall access control strategy.

### Role-based Access Control

Role-based Access Control (RBAC) regulates user access to resources by leveraging predefined roles and permissions. This approach enhances the security and manageability of our system by providing a structured authorization framework.
