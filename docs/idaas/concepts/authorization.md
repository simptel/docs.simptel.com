# Authorization Overview

This chapter provides an overview of the fundamental concepts and best practices guiding access control and authorization protocols within our platform.

## Authorization Protocols

### OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE for Users

The Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is a critical aspect of our authorization strategy, providing a secure method to obtain access tokens on behalf of a user. It can be implemented using client libraries for common use cases such as:

- Mobile Applications
- SaaS Platforms
- Websites
- Desktop Applications
- Single Sign-On (SSO)

For more details, refer to the [OAuth 2.0 RFC 7636](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636).

### OAuth 2.0 Client Credential Flow for Machine-to-Machine Communication

The Client Credential Flow enables secure authorization for machine-to-machine communication and non-user specific access to protected resources. It allows clients to securely authenticate and obtain access tokens based on their credentials. This flow can be implemented using client libraries for the following common use cases:

- Scheduled Tasks and Cron Jobs
- Data Synchronization
- System-to-system integrations
- Inter-Microservice Communication
- Internet of Things (IoT) Device Communication
- Automated Testing Environments

For more details, refer to [OAuth 2.0 RFC 6749 Section 1.3.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.4).
