# Access Control Overview

This section provides an overview of the essential concepts guiding access control, encompassing authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) within our system.

## Authentication
Authentication (authn) is the process of verifying the identity of users, systems, or entities attempting to access our platform. Robust authentication mechanisms ensure that only authorized and legitimate users gain entry.

## Authorization
Authorization (authz) involves granting or denying permissions to authenticated entities based on their identity. This step defines the actions or operations users are allowed to perform once their identity is verified through authentication.

## Accounting
Accounting (auditing) involves logging and monitoring access events. It provides a record of who accessed what resources, when, and the actions taken. Accounting is crucial for security monitoring, compliance, and incident response.

## Access Control Models

In our platform, we offer various access control models, each providing different levels of granularity for controlling resource access.

### Role-based Access Control (RBAC)

**Assignment:**
- Entities: Users or clients
- Assignment: Predefined roles

Role-based Access Control (RBAC) is a robust access control model that limits access to authorized users or clients based on pre-defined roles. RBAC determines access permissions to resources based on user roles, rather than individual attributes. Each role is associated with a set of permissions that govern the actions a user with that role is authorized to perform.

```javascript
// RBAC Example
if (role === "manager") {
    // Allow access to the sensitive document
} else {
    // Deny access
}
```

### Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC)

Assignment:

- Entities: Users or clients
- Assignment: Attributes such as roles, permissions, departments, office hours, and locations

Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) is a granular access control mechanism that enables fine-grained control over resource access based on the attributes associated with users or clients. ABAC safeguards resources at a granular level, considering specific attributes such as `roles`, `permissions`, `departments`, `office hours`, and `locations`. This approach facilitates precise access controls based on specific user attributes, ensuring robust data security and compliance with best practices.

```javascript
// ABAC Example 
if (
    attributes.includes("role:manager") &&
    attributes.includes("permission:read:document") &&
    attributes.includes("department:marketing") &&
    attributes.includes("location:office")
) {
    // Allow access to the sensitive document
} else {
    // Deny access
}
```

### Access Control Lists (ACLs)

- Entities: Users or clients
- Assignment: Specific resources and allowed operations

Access Control Lists (ACLs) are a mechanism for defining which users or groups of users are granted access to specific resources and the operations they are permitted to perform on those resources. ACLs offer fine-grained control over resource access by specifying detailed permissions and denials for specific users or groups.

```javascript
// ACL Example 
if (document === "example.docx" && user === "John" && permission === "read") {
    // Allow access to read the document
} else {
    // Deny access
}
```

In summary:

- RBAC focuses on predefined roles for user access control.
- ABAC utilizes specific attributes for granular control over resource access.
- ACLs specify resource access and operations for individual users or groups.
