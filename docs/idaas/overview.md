# Identity as a Service (IDaaS)

Explore the functionality of our Identity as a Service (IDaaS), a modern cloud-based solution with two essential components:

- **Selfservice portal (SSP)**
- **Hub**

The Hub, acting as a centralized management interface, seamlessly integrates with the user-friendly Selfservice portal. This versatile solution can be deployed out of the box and tailored to specific needs through customization using our API.

## Standards and Future Plans

Our commitment to robust security is reflected in the strict adherence to industry standards:

## Security and Access Management Standards

- **[OAuth 2.1](https://oauth.net/2.1/)**
- **[OpenID](https://openid.net/)**

As part of our ongoing commitment to maintaining the highest security standards, we have **[FAPI 2.0](https://oauth.net/fapi/)** on our roadmap.

### Access Management Standards

- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**
- **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)**
- **PSM (Privileged Session Management)**
- **PIM (Privileged Identity Management)**
- **PAM (Privileged Access Management)**

Our IDaaS aims to simplify the implementation of these standards, providing tools to fortify your infrastructure and secure applications.
