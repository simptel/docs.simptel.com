# Data regions

When you first sign up to the Platform, you will be given the option to choose your **data region** during tenant creation.

Regions define where the Platform stores data for your customers and business. You may need to select a specific region to meet your regulatory requirements.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important note**

Once selected, you cannot change the data region of your business within the Platform.
{% endhint %}

***

## **Supported Regions**

Currently, we support the following regions (with more to follow):

* Asia-Pacific
* Europe

{% hint style="info" %}
To ensure optimal performance, we strongly recommend choosing a region closest to your customers and where your app, site, or platform is hosted. For example:

* If you are in the Netherlands, choose the EU region.
* If you are in India, choose the Asia Pacific region.
{% endhint %}

## Failover Support

We currently have failover support within regions. However, we do not have cross-regional failover support. This ensures that data stays within the selected region.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have any questions about how your data is stored, please email us at [support@tfplatform.com](https://sourcegraph.com/cody/chat). You can also read our [privacy policy](https://www.simptel.com/legal/privacy).
