# Organizations

With TF Platform, you can manage Organizations that serve as **top-level** entities, allowing the creation and management of multiple projects. You can easily register an organization using your TF Platform account.

{% hint style="info" %}
Users can be members of multiple organizations if invited by the admin of other organizations. However, you can only register and own one organization for your TF Platform account.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
