# CORS

### What is CORS? <a href="#seo-faq-pairs-what-is-cross-origin-resource-sharing" id="seo-faq-pairs-what-is-cross-origin-resource-sharing"></a>

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows web applications to make requests to resources hosted on different domains.&#x20;

The platform lets you configure CORS at the tenant level, enabling precise control over cross-origin access for improved security and flexibility.

### Best Practices

* Regularly review and update your CORS settings to align with security requirements.
* Always use HTTPS in production for secure communication.
* Avoid using the wildcard `*` in production; explicitly specify allowed origins.
