## About Billing Accounts

The TF Platform operates on a **pay-as-you-go** model, which means you only pay for the resources and services you actually use. To access these services, a TF Platform billing account is required. Additionally, billing must be enabled on any project utilizing TF Platform resources.

### **Types of Billing Accounts**

* **Self-service (Prepaid):** This is the default option, allowing you to manage and pay for services upfront. You have full control over your budget, and you can enable **auto top-up** to automatically replenish your account when it reaches a specified balance, ensuring you never run out of funds.
* **Invoiced (Postpaid):** This option requires a contract and allows you to receive an invoice for services at the end of the billing cycle. It provides convenience for businesses with regular expenses. **For inquiries related to postpaid billing accounts, please contact support for assistance.**

### Pricing Information

For detailed pricing information regarding platform usage, please refer to the pricing sheet provided by your technical account manager. Key components include:

* Monthly Active Users
* Token Operations
* Access Operations
* Data Transfer
* Logging

Consumption is tied to the projects associated with your billing account and will be invoiced accordingly. Every resource or service consumed within the platform is linked to a billing account.
