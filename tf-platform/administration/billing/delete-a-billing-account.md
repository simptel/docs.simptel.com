# Delete a billing account

TF Platform Billing accounts cannot be deleted. When you close your TF Platform Billing account, the account information is retained for reporting and auditing purposes.

To prevent your TF Platform Billing account from accruing charges, you can either:

* **Disable the TF Platform account.**
* **Unlink the billing account from associated projects.**

If you need to change the payment method linked to your TF Platform Billing account, you can manage your payment options in the **Billing Accounts** section.
