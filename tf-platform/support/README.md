If you require a higher service quota to accommodate your business needs, our TF Platform Support team can assist. To request an increase in resources:

1. Prepare your tenant ID.
2. Send an email to support@simptel.com with the subject line "TF Platform Quota Request."
3. In the email body, include your Tenant ID and specify the details of the quota increase you are requesting.
